## Printers
 
Zebra printers have different product lines, such as card printers, desktop printers, mobile printers, print engine printers and industrial printers. The serial number location may vary depending on the product line and model. Generally, the serial number is located at the bottom or back of the printer. In some models, the serial number location could be at the front or side panel (slide down the opener to view the serial number).[^1^]
 
## Mobile Computers
 
Zebra mobile computers include handheld computers, vehicle mounted computers and tablets. The serial number location may vary depending on the product line and model. Generally, the serial number is located at the back of the device under the battery cover or on a label. In some devices, the serial number location could be in the settings menu or on a sticker on the side of the device.[^1^]
 
## Scanners
 
Zebra scanners include general purpose scanners, rugged scanners, portable and companion scanners and ultra-rugged scanners. The serial number location may vary depending on the product line and model. Generally, the serial number is located at the bottom of the scanner or on a label on the back or side of the scanner.[^1^]
 
## RFID
 
Zebra RFID products include handheld readers and fixed readers. The serial number location may vary depending on the product line and model. Generally, the serial number is located at the back or bottom of the reader or on a label on the side of the reader.[^1^]
 
## Zebralette
 
Zebralette is a free software synthesizer that is part of the Zebra2 bundle. It is a simplified version of Zebra2 that only uses one oscillator module. You do not need a serial number to use Zebralette as it is free and without any restrictions. However, if you want to use Zebra2 or Zebrify, which are also included in the bundle but require registration, you will need a serial number that can be obtained from u-he's website.[^2^] [^3^]

## Zebra2
 
Zebra2 is a powerful and versatile software synthesizer that combines multiple synthesis techniques, such as subtractive, additive, wavetable, frequency modulation, phase distortion and physical modeling. Zebra2 can create a wide range of sounds, from warm analog pads and basses to crisp digital leads and plucks, and everything in between. Zebra2 is also known for its high-quality sound and low CPU usage, making it ideal for both studio and live performance.
 
### Oscillators
 
Zebra2 features four powerful wavetable oscillators (16 waves) with integrated spectral effects. Each oscillator can produce up to 11 voices of unison, with detune and stereo spread controls. The oscillators can also be modulated by various sources, such as envelopes, LFOs, other oscillators or noise generators. Zebra2 also includes four FM oscillators with eight alternative waveforms (not only sine) for creating complex harmonic textures and metallic timbres.
 
### Filters
 
Zebra2 offers four regular filters with 23 different modes, ranging from classic low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and notch filters to more exotic types such as comb, formant, allpass and ring modulation filters. The filters can be modulated by various sources, such as envelopes, LFOs, other filters or noise generators. Zebra2 also features four cross-modulation filters (XMF) that can modulate each other's cutoff frequencies or resonance values, creating dynamic and expressive filter effects.

### Effects
 
Zebra2 includes a comprehensive set of 21 stereo effects that can be applied to the signal chain in various ways. The effects include two chorus/flanger units, two delay units, two equalizer units, two compressor units, two reverb units and more. The effects can also be modulated by various sources, such as envelopes, LFOs or other effects. It is also possible to use certain generators as effects, such as shape, VCF or distortion. Zebra2 lets you modulate practically all effect parameters (e.g. reverb size or delay feedback).
 
### Modulation
 
Zebra2 features a flexible and powerful modulation system that allows you to control almost any parameter with almost any source. The modulation sources include four syncable multi-stage envelope generators (MSEG) with up to 32 segments each, four per-voice LFOs plus two global LFOs, four assignable X/Y pads and a 12-slot modulation matrix with depth modulation from a second source. The modulation destinations include all oscillator, filter and effect parameters, as well as global parameters such as master volume or pitch bend.
 
### Arpeggiator and Sequencer
 
Zebra2 features a fully-fledged arpeggiator and sequencer that can create complex and rhythmic patterns based on the notes you play. The arpeggiator and sequencer can have up to 16 steps each, with various loop and order options. They also include two extra values per step, which can be used to modulate any parameter in step with the arpeggiator or sequencer.[^1^]
 
### Interface
 
Zebra2 has a user-friendly and resizable interface that lets you customize your workflow and access the features you need. You can choose from different skins and themes to suit your taste and screen size. You can also use the MIDI learn page and editable list to assign MIDI controllers to any parameter. Zebra2 supports VST2, VST3, AU and AAX plugin formats on Windows, macOS and Linux platforms.[^1^]
 
### Presets
 
Zebra2 comes with over 500 factory presets that cover a wide range of styles and genres. The presets are fully tagged and NKS-ready for easy browsing and integration with Native Instruments hardware. You can also create your own presets using Zebra2's powerful sound design features or download additional soundsets from u-he or third-party developers.[^1^]
