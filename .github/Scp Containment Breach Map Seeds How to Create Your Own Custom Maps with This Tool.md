# How to Find the Best SCP Containment Breach Map Seeds
 
SCP Containment Breach is a survival horror game based on the works of the SCP Foundation community. In this game, you have to escape from a facility where anomalous entities are contained and try to survive various obstacles and threats. The game features a procedurally generated map that changes every time you play, making each run unique and unpredictable.
 
However, not all maps are created equal. Some maps may be easier or harder than others, depending on the layout, the items, the SCPs and the events that occur. That's why some players use map seeds to generate specific maps that they like or want to challenge themselves with. A map seed is a code that determines how the map is generated. By entering a map seed in the game options, you can play the same map as someone else who used the same seed.

## Tips and Tricks for Playing SCP Containment Breach
 
SCP Containment Breach is not an easy game to beat. It requires a lot of skill, patience and luck to survive and escape the facility. However, there are some tips and tricks that can help you improve your chances of success. Here are some of them:

- Save often. The game has a quick save feature that allows you to save your progress at any time by pressing F5. You can also quick load by pressing F9. This is very useful when you encounter a dangerous situation or make a mistake. However, be careful not to save when you are in a bad spot or when an SCP is nearby, as this can make things worse.
- Use the S-Nav 3000. This is a device that shows you a map of the facility and your location on it. It also shows you where the SCPs are and what they are doing. You can use it to plan your route and avoid unwanted encounters. You can also upgrade it to the S-Nav 3100 or the S-Nav Ultimate by using SCP-914.
- Use SCP-914. This is a machine that can upgrade or downgrade items by putting them in its input booth and selecting a setting. You can use it to improve your keycards, gas mask, night vision goggles, batteries and other items. However, be careful not to use it on SCP items or humanoids, as this can have unpredictable or harmful effects.
- Use SCP-714. This is a jade ring that grants you immunity to some SCPs' effects, such as SCP-049's touch, SCP-012's compulsion, SCP-895's hallucinations and SCP-966's sleep deprivation. It also slows down your stamina drain and reduces the damage you take from physical attacks. However, it also slows down your movement speed and makes you more vulnerable to mental attacks.
- Use Tesla Gates. These are devices that electrocute anything that passes through them. You can use them to kill or deter some SCPs, such as SCP-173, SCP-049, SCP-096 and SCP-106. However, be careful not to get caught in them yourself, as they will kill you instantly.

These are some of the tips and tricks that can help you beat SCP Containment Breach. However, remember that the game is still very unpredictable and challenging, so don't expect to win every time. The best way to learn is by playing and experimenting with different strategies and scenarios. Good luck!
