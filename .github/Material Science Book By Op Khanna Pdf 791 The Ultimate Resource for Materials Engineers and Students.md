Those in the active group are directly involved in the energy-conversion process and include fuels, catalysts, electrodes, and magnets. Another way to classify energy materials is by their function in the various stages of energy production, distribution, conversion, and utilization. For example, materials for energy production include nuclear fuels, solar cells, wind turbines, and batteries. Materials for energy distribution include superconductors, power lines, and pipelines. Materials for energy conversion include thermoelectric materials, piezoelectric materials, and fuel cells. Materials for energy utilization include light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and sensors.
 
Materials science and metallurgy play a crucial role in developing and improving energy materials for various applications. By understanding the structure-property relationships of materials at different scales, from atomic to macroscopic, materials scientists and metallurgists can design new materials with desired properties and performance. For example, by manipulating the composition, microstructure, and defects of materials, they can enhance their electrical, thermal, optical, magnetic, or mechanical properties. By applying various processing techniques, such as casting, forging, rolling, annealing, quenching, tempering, sintering, or coating, they can modify the structure and morphology of materials to improve their stability and durability. By using various characterization methods, such as microscopy, spectroscopy, diffraction, or testing, they can evaluate the quality and functionality of materials under different conditions.
 
Materials science and metallurgy also contribute to solving some of the challenges and problems associated with energy materials. For example, they can help to reduce the cost and environmental impact of energy materials by finding alternative or renewable sources of raw materials, by developing more efficient and less wasteful processes of extraction and fabrication, by recycling and reusing materials at the end of their life cycle, and by minimizing or eliminating toxic or hazardous emissions and wastes. They can also help to enhance the safety and reliability of energy materials by preventing or mitigating failures such as corrosion, fatigue, fracture, creep, wear, or degradation.
 
Some examples of energy materials that have been developed or improved by materials science and metallurgy are:
 
- Nuclear fuels: These are materials that can undergo nuclear fission or fusion to produce heat and electricity. Nuclear fuels include uranium , plutonium , thorium , and hydrogen . Materials science and metallurgy help to optimize the composition, structure, and performance of nuclear fuels for different types of reactors , such as pressurized water reactors (PWRs), boiling water reactors (BWRs), fast breeder reactors (FBRs), or fusion reactors . They also help to ensure the safe handling , storage , transportation , and disposal of nuclear fuels and wastes.
- Solar cells: These are devices that convert sunlight into electricity. Solar cells are made of semiconductors , such as silicon , gallium arsenide , cadmium telluride , or perovskites . Materials science and metallurgy help to improve the efficiency , stability , and durability of solar cells by controlling the doping , defect , grain boundary , interface , and surface properties of semiconductors. They also help to reduce the cost and environmental impact of solar cells by developing new fabrication methods , such as thin-film deposition , printing , or self-assembly .
- Wind turbines: These are machines that convert wind energy into electricity. Wind turbines consist of blades , hubs , generators , gearboxes , towers , and foundations . Materials science and metallurgy help to enhance the strength , stiffness , fatigue resistance , corrosion resistance , wear resistance , and noise reduction of wind turbine components by selecting or designing suitable materials , such as metals , polymers , composites , or ceramics . They also help to optimize the shape , size , weight , and aerodynamics of wind turbine components by using computational modeling , simulation , or testing.
- Batteries: These are devices that store electrical energy in chemical form. Batteries consist of electrodes , electrolytes , separators , current collectors , cases , and terminals . Materials science and metallurgy help to increase the capacity , power density , cycle life , safety , and sustainability of batteries by developing new materials or improving existing ones for different types of batteries , such as lead-acid batteries (PbA), nickel-cadmium batteries (NiCd), nickel-metal hydride batteries (NiMH), lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion), lithium-sulfur batteries (Li-S), or sodium-ion batteries (Na-ion).
