The Bhagavad Gita is one of the most sacred and revered texts in Hinduism. It is a dialogue between Lord Krishna and Arjuna, a warrior prince who faces a moral dilemma on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. The Gita teaches the essence of dharma, karma, bhakti, jnana and yoga, and guides the seeker towards the supreme goal of self-realization.
  
Among the many commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita, one of the most popular and influential is the one by Swami Chinmayananda, a renowned spiritual master and founder of Chinmaya Mission. Swami Chinmayananda's commentary is based on the original Sanskrit verses, with transliteration, word-by-word meaning and detailed explanation. He brings out the profound wisdom and practical relevance of the Gita for the modern reader.
