Ocean Way Studios is not just another reverb plugin. It's a dynamic room modeling plugin that captures the unique acoustics and microphone setups of two iconic studios: Studio A and Studio B. You can choose from different source types, such as drums, vocals, guitars, pianos, and more, and mix them through vintage microphones that were hand-picked by Allen Sides, the founder of Ocean Way Studios.
 
With the Ocean Way Studio plugin, you can adjust the distance and position of up to three microphone pairs (Near, Mid, Far) in real time, and blend them to create your own custom sound. You can also EQ and filter each microphone pair, and control the amount of mic bleed and proximity effect. The plugin uses UA's proprietary Dynamic Room Modeling technology, which emulates the natural sound dispersion and reflections of each room and source.
 
The result is a stunningly realistic and immersive mixing experience that will make your tracks sound like they were recorded and mixed at Ocean Way Studios. Whether you want to add some depth and dimension to your close-miked drums, or make your vocals shine with some natural ambience, or give your guitars some edge and character, the Ocean Way Studio plugin can help you achieve your sonic goals.
 
The Ocean Way Studio plugin is compatible with UAD-2 hardware and Apollo interfaces, and it's available for purchase from Universal Audio's website. You can also try it for free for 14 days with Splice Rent-to-Own. Don't miss this opportunity to mix like a pro with the Ocean Way Studio plugin!
