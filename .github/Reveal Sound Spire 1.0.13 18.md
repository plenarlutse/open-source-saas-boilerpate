In this article, we will explore some of the features and capabilities of Reveal Sound Spire 1.0.13 18 in more detail. We will also provide some tips and tricks on how to use it effectively and creatively.
 
## Oscillators
 
Spire has four independent oscillators, each with nine different waveforms: Classic, Noise, FM, AMSync, SawPWM, HardFM, Vowel, Chiptune, and Wavetable. You can mix and match these waveforms to create complex and rich sounds. You can also adjust the phase, detune, width, and mix of each oscillator.
 
One of the unique features of Spire's oscillators is the Unison mode. This mode allows you to stack up to nine voices per oscillator, creating a huge and fat sound. You can also control the unison detune, spread, and blend parameters for each oscillator. Additionally, you can choose from seven different unison modes: Classic, SuperSaw, SuperHardSaw, SuperSoftSaw, SuperSquare, SuperPulse, and SuperTone.
 
Another feature of Spire's oscillators is the Harmonics mode. This mode allows you to edit the harmonic content of each oscillator's waveform using a graphical editor. You can draw your own harmonics or use one of the presets. You can also apply different filters and effects to the harmonics, such as lowpass, highpass, bandpass, notch, comb, shaper, bitcrusher, and decimator.
 
## Filters
 
Spire has two multimode filters that can operate in serial or parallel mode. Each filter has 12 different types: Low Pass (6 variations), High Pass (6 variations), Band Pass (4 variations), Peak EQ (4 variations), Notch (4 variations), Comb (2 variations), Acid (2 variations), Scream (2 variations), Formant (2 variations), Shaper (2 variations), and Vowel (2 variations). You can also adjust the cutoff frequency, resonance, drive, keytrack, and modulation amount of each filter.
 
One of the interesting features of Spire's filters is the Perfecto mode. This mode emulates the analog behavior of some classic filters by adding some subtle distortion and saturation to the sound. You can enable or disable this mode for each filter separately.
 
Another feature of Spire's filters is the Scorpion mode. This mode adds a special nonlinear feedback circuit to the filter that creates a more aggressive and resonant sound. You can enable or disable this mode for each filter separately.
 
## LFOs
 
Spire has four low-frequency oscillators that can modulate various parameters of the sound engine. Each LFO has six different waveforms: Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth, Square, Sample & Hold, and Noise. You can also adjust the rate, phase sync mode (free or tempo-synced), fade in time, delay time, rise time (for sample & hold waveform only), and modulation amount of each LFO.
 
One of the useful features of Spire's LFOs is the Retrig mode. This mode allows you to reset the LFO phase every time a new note is played. This can create more rhythmic and consistent modulation effects.
 
Another feature of Spire's LFOs is the Shape mode. This mode allows you to modify the shape of each LFO waveform using a graphical editor. You can draw your own shape or use one of the presets. You can also apply different filters and effects to the shape, such as lowpass, highpass, bandpass
