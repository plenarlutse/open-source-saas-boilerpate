These are some of the questions that Alex Inkeles, a prominent sociologist and professor at Stanford University, addresses in his book *What Is Sociology: An Introduction to the Discipline and the Profession*. Published in 1964, this book is one of the first comprehensive and accessible introductions to sociology for students, teachers and general readers. It covers the basic elements of sociology, such as its subject matter, perspective, models of society, conceptions of man, social processes and methods of inquiry. It also discusses the history and evolution of sociology, its relation to other disciplines, its main branches and fields of specialization, and its professional roles and ethics.
 
Inkeles writes in a clear and engaging style, using examples from various societies and cultures to illustrate his points. He also provides a bibliography of relevant sources for further reading. The book is organized into eight chapters, each with a summary and a set of questions for discussion. The chapters are:
 
- The Subject Matter of Sociology
- The Sociological Perspective
- Models of Society in Sociological Analysis
- Conceptions of Man in Sociological Analysis
- Basic Elements of Social Life
- Fundamental Social Processes
- Models of Inquiry in Sociology
- Sociology as a Profession

Inkeles' book is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about sociology as a discipline and a profession. It offers a comprehensive overview of the scope, methods and goals of sociology, as well as its challenges and opportunities in the modern world. It also reflects Inkeles' own contributions to sociology, especially in the fields of social change, modernization and comparative analysis. The book is still relevant today, as it provides a solid foundation for understanding the complex and dynamic nature of human societies.

Alex Inkeles was not only a distinguished scholar of sociology, but also a pioneer in the field of social psychology. He developed the concept of "socialization", which refers to the process by which individuals learn and internalize the norms, values and roles of their society. He also proposed the idea of "national character", which is the distinctive pattern of personality traits and attitudes that characterize a nation or culture. He conducted extensive empirical research on these topics, using surveys, interviews and experiments to compare different societies and groups.
 
Inkeles was also interested in the phenomenon of social change and modernization, especially in developing countries. He examined how economic development, urbanization, education, mass media and political participation affect the social structure, culture and personality of individuals and societies. He collaborated with other scholars in several cross-national projects, such as the Human Relations Area Files, the World Fertility Survey and the World Values Survey. He also wrote influential books on these topics, such as *Becoming Modern: Individual Change in Six Developing Countries* (1974) and *National Character: A Psycho-Social Perspective* (1997).
 
Inkeles had a long and productive career as a sociologist and a social psychologist. He taught at Harvard University for 23 years and at Stanford University for 18 years. He was also a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a founding editor of the *Annual Review of Sociology*. He received many honors and awards for his contributions to sociology, such as membership in the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He also served as president of the International Sociological Association from 1974 to 1978.
