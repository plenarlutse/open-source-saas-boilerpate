Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC is a comprehensive suite of UI components that enables you to build modern, responsive, and interactive web applications using the ASP.NET MVC framework. The latest release, R1 2018, brings many new features and improvements to the existing components, as well as some brand new ones. Here are some of the highlights of this release:
 
- **Using Vue components in the templates of the Vue wrappers**: You can now use Vue components as templates for the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC components that support Vue wrappers, such as Grid, ListView, Scheduler, and more. This allows you to leverage the power and flexibility of Vue in your ASP.NET MVC applications.
- **Unified height of inputs and buttons**: The input and button components, such as AutoComplete, ComboBox, DatePicker, Button, and others, now have a consistent height across all themes and browsers. This improves the visual appearance and alignment of your UI elements.
- **EnforceMinLength option for AutoComplete and ComboBox**: You can now specify a minimum number of characters that the user has to type before the AutoComplete or ComboBox component starts filtering the data source. This can improve the performance and usability of your application when dealing with large data sets.
- **TimeDurationPicker component**: This is a new component that allows the user to select a time duration in hours, minutes, and seconds. It is useful for scenarios where you need to capture the duration of an event or activity, such as a timer, stopwatch, or countdown.
- **Signature component**: This component allows the user to draw a signature with their mouse or touch device and save it as an image. It is useful for scenarios where you need to capture the user's consent or approval, such as a contract, invoice, or form.
- **TaskBoard component**: This component allows you to create a Kanban-style board with cards that represent tasks or items. You can drag and drop the cards between different columns that represent different stages or statuses of the tasks. It is useful for scenarios where you need to manage workflows, projects, or processes.
