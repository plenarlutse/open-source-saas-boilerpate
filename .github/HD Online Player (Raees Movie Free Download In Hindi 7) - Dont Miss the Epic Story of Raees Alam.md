The film follows the rise and fall of Raees (Shah Rukh Khan), a smart and ambitious boy who gets involved in the illegal liquor trade at a young age. He uses his mother's philosophy that no occupation is low and no religion greater than any occupation as long as it does not harm anyone.

He also marries his neighbour Aasiya (Mahira Khan) and has a son with her.

However, his success attracts the attention of ACP J.A. Majmudar (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), an honest and determined police officer who is transferred to Fatehpur to stop Raees' illegal activities. Raees and Majmudar engage in a cat-and-mouse game, as Raees tries to evade Majmudar's traps and raids, while Majmudar tries to catch him red-handed. Raees also faces challenges from his rivals, such as Jairaj (Atul Kulkarni), a former gangster who wants to kill him, and Pashabhai (Pankaj Tripathi), a shrewd politician who wants to use him for his own gains.
 
Raees' life takes a turn for the worse when he gets involved in a gold smuggling deal that turns out to be a terrorist plot. He realizes that he has been betrayed by Musabhai, who used him to smuggle RDX explosives that caused serial bomb blasts in North India. Raees kills Musabhai for his treachery, but also becomes a wanted criminal for his role in the blasts. He loses his money, his reputation and his family, as Aasiya leaves him with their son. He also loses his political support from the Chief Minister (Manoj Joshi), who joins hands with Pashabhai.
 
In the end, Raees surrenders to Majmudar, who takes him to an isolated place to kill him. Raees accepts his fate and asks Majmudar to take care of his people. Majmudar shoots him dead and declares that he has killed Raees.

Raees is not just a film about a criminal, but also a film about the socio-political scenario of Gujarat in the 1980s and 1990s. The film depicts the issues of prohibition, communalism, corruption and terrorism that plagued the state during that period. The film also explores the themes of ambition, loyalty, morality and justice through the characters of Raees and Majmudar.
 
Raees is also a showcase of Shah Rukh Khan's versatility as an actor. He plays a character that is different from his usual romantic hero roles. He portrays Raees as a complex and flawed human being, who has both good and bad qualities. He shows his charisma, intensity and vulnerability in different scenes. He also delivers some powerful dialogues that have become popular among his fans.
 
Nawazuddin Siddiqui is equally brilliant as Majmudar, the nemesis of Raees. He plays a cop who is witty, fearless and relentless in his pursuit of justice. He matches Khan's screen presence and provides some comic relief in the otherwise serious film. He also shares a great chemistry with Khan, as they have some memorable confrontations and conversations.
 
Mahira Khan makes her Bollywood debut as Aasiya, the wife of Raees. She plays a simple and supportive woman, who loves Raees despite his flaws. She has a natural charm and grace that suits her character. She also shares a good rapport with Khan, as they have some romantic and emotional scenes.
 
The supporting cast of the film also does a commendable job. Narendra Jha as Musabhai, Atul Kulkarni as Jairaj, Pankaj Tripathi as Pashabhai, Manoj Joshi as the Chief Minister and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub as Sadiq all play their parts well. Sunny Leone makes a special appearance in the song "Laila Main Laila", which is a remake of the classic song from Qurbani (1980).
