# How to use POInspect0r to import POI files to RNS 510 navigation system
 
If you have a Volkswagen model with an RNS 510 navigation system, you may want to import your own POI (point of interest) files to customize your map view and alerts. For example, you may want to add speed cameras, gas stations, restaurants, or other places of interest to your navigation system. One of the tools that can help you do this is POInspect0r[^4^], a free utility that can create a database file for your RNS 510 system from either TomTom or CSV files.

In this article, we will show you how to use POInspect0r to import POI files to your RNS 510 navigation system. You will need a Windows PC, an SD card, and some POI files that you want to import. You can download POI files from various sources on the internet, such as [POI Factory](http://www.poi-factory.com/) [^5^].
 
## Step 1: Download and install POInspect0r
 
You can download POInspect0r from [this website](http://poinspect0r.blogspot.com/) [^1^]. The latest version as of this writing is 6.8. You may need to disable your antivirus software temporarily as some antivirus programs may flag POInspect0r as a potential threat. Once you have downloaded the zip file, extract it to a folder on your PC and run the setup.exe file. Follow the instructions to install POInspect0r on your PC.
 
## Step 2: Prepare the POI data
 
Before you can use POInspect0r to create a database file for your RNS 510 system, you need to prepare the POI data that you want to import. The POI data should be in either TomTom (\*.ov2) or CSV (\*.csv) format. You can convert other formats such as GPX or KML to CSV using online tools such as [GPS Visualizer](https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/convert_input). You also need to make sure that the codepage of the POI data matches the codepage of your RNS 510 system. For example, if your RNS 510 system uses Western European codepage (ISO-8859-1), you need to make sure that your POI data is also in ISO-8859-1 codepage. You can use tools such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) to change the codepage of your POI data.
 
The structure of the CSV file should be as follows:

    Name,Latitude,Longitude,[Optional: Alert distance],[Optional: Alert speed],[Optional: Alert sound],[Optional: Alert message]

For example:

    Speed Camera,-33.86785,151.20732,500,60,speedcam.wav,"Speed camera ahead"

## Step 3: Start program and create a new database
 
Once you have prepared the POI data, you can start POInspect0r and create a new database for your RNS 510 system. To do this, follow these steps:
